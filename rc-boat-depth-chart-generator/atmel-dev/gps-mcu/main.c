/*
 * Description:
 * This program interfaces with an ATmega1284 microcontroller to communicate with a GPS receiver and another ATmega1284 to send data back and forth. 
 * A stream of GPS data is parsed for $GPGGA sentences and then the latitude/longitude are grabbed and stored into a buffer which is then sent to MCU2.
 * Once that cycle completes the program also writes the depth data that is received from MCU2 and the GPS data to an LCD. 
 *   
 * Notes:
 * - The latitude and longitude values written to the SD card are in the form 'ddmm.mmmm', known as degree and decimal
 *   minute (DMM) format.
 * - MCU1 refers to the microcontroller interfacing with the GPS receiver and LCD display.
 * - MCU2 refers to the microcontroller interfacing with the Blue Robotics Ping Sensor and microSD card reader.
 *   
 * IDE:
 * Atmel Studio 7
